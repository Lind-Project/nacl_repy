Subsidiary handlers for the exec system call. The main handler is implemented by NaCl.

Called from dispatcher.repy

Safe version checks all parameters, then calls real handler that execs the file system.

exec handler pulls out the arguments, does any mandatory checking
then calls the repy posix library exec system call.  Then packs
the result back up.
