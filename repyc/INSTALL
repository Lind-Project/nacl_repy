To build repyc the scons build system must be installed, and you 
must also have the python 2.5-2.6 development package installed.

# first install repyv2 somewhere:
% cd repy
% python preparetest.py -t /home/cmatthew/tmp/repy

# now set a environment variable so repyc can detect repy
% export REPY_PATH=/home/cmatthew/tmp/repy

# compile repyc (you will need gcc for that)
% cd repyc
% scons

# try out the test program or the hello world
% ./bin/test/hello
% ./bin/tests/test

# librepyc.ar (static library)  is build during the compile. to
# compile your own programs:

% gcc -o foo.o -c foo.c -I~/path_to_repy.h
% gcc -o foo foo.o src/repy.h bin/lib/librepyc.a -lpython2.6
