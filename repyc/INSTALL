To build repyc the scons build system must be installed, and you 
must also have the python 2.5-2.6 development package installed.

#first install repyv2 somewhere:
% cd repy
% python preparetest.py -t /home/cmatthew/tmp/repy
#now set a environment variable so repyc can detect repy
% export REPY_PATH=/home/cmatthew/tmp/repy
#compile repyc (you will need gcc for that)
% cd repyc
% scons
#try out the test program or the hello world
% ./bin/test/hello
% ./bin/tests/test
