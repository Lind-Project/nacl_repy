<Purpose>
  Proxy server for non-shim-compatible applications. We can use it, for
  instance, to wget files from an apache server, such that both applications
  appear to use shims. Here is the set-up:

  Host A runs Apache. This proxy listens for incoming connections from other
  proxies using shims. When a new client is connected, the proxy makes a
  non-shim connection to the Apache server on port 80.

  Host B runs wget. This proxy listens for incoming connections from wget
  without using shims. When wget connects to the proxy, we make a shim'ed
  connection to the destination proxy server.

"""

USAGE = """
  The command-line arguments are:
  [outgoing IP] [outgoing port] [incoming port] [shim'ed port]

  The shim'ed port must be either the outgoing openconnection port, or the
  incoming listen port; it designates the usage of shims on either ports. Avoid
  ports 10000 to 60000 as they are used for local openconnection ports.

  In the example above, we run:
  - on host A: proxy.repy host_A_ip 80            listen_port_A listen_port_A
  - on host B: proxy.repy host_A_ip listen_port_A listen_port_B listen_port_A
