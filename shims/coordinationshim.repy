<Purpose>
  Advertises the server's string representation of its shim stack. When a client
  is about to connect to this server, the coordination shim looks up the string
  representation and constructs the same shims. At this point, both the server
  and the client have the same shims. As their shim stacks are balanced, the
  connection is established and ready to be returned to the application.

  The advertisement key for a server is "host,port,protocol", where host is the
  hostname of the server and protocol can be either UDP or TCP. The
  advertisement value is the string representation of the CoordinationShim's
  shim stack.

  If a zenodotus name is provided to listenforconn, this shim will also
  advertise the mapping of the name to the current IP address of the host. Any
  change in the IP address will cause the mapping to be updated, but unless used
  along with the mobility shim, the listener will not be able to accept new
  connections because it is bound to the old IP address.

  The coordination shim should always sit on top of an application's shim stack,
  so that it can see the content of the rest of the stack.
